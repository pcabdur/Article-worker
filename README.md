## 📌 Overview

**Article Worker** is a Node.js background worker that processes article-related tasks asynchronously using a queue-based architecture.

It offloads heavy operations (parsing, validation, transformation, storage) from the main API so your app stays fast and responsive.

This README contains **everything in one place**:  
architecture, setup, and **example worker + queue + DB code**.
